Ah, so you've forgotten how to play? Not to worry, I can provide a quick refresher. 

//scripted step, wait for click
Click a card at the bottom of the screen to use it

//scripted step, wait for cast


That's all the controls you'll need, look at you go!

//wait for trail collapse
Move across that trail that's behind you to collapse it.

Nicely done! When you collapse your trail you'll consume any red cells caught inside.

//scripted step, go through these texts while waiting for a kill to occur 
Surrounding them might take a little practice, touching a red cell or a much bigger cell destroys your trail. 
Hitting red cells will also cause you to lose health in "Balanced" or "Difficult" modes.
Go ahead and try surrounding a couple red cells with your trail and then collapsing it.

//wait for level up
Looks like you consumed some red cells, well played! 
The main goal of the "Balanced" and "Difficult" modes is to consume the red cells fast enough that they don't overwhelm you.
As you consume them, you'll fill the bar that appears at the bottom of the screen.
You get another trail segment when it fills, making it easier to surround large groups of red cells.
See if you can consume enough red cells to fill the bar now.

Nice! Hear that? That's the sound of progress. (This game is best played with the sound on!)
Each red cell consumed also increases your score up here. 
You can keep playing here as long as you want, this is the equivalent of the "Casual" game difficulty.
Enjoy the game!
